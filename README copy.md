# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (Media Queries)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/app` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `src/assets/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

Not sure how to import your images? [Check the docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/)

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts. These notes are also located in your app's style directory (`/src/styles/App.css`)
